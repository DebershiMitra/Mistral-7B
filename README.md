# Mistral-7B
I developed and implemented a system leveraging AWS services, particularly boto3, to invoke the Mistral 7B model for inference tasks. This involved constructing and sending requests formatted in JSON, with error handling integrated using botocore.exceptions.ClientError and logging mechanisms.
To optimize natural language processing (NLP) performance, I embedded prompts within instructional templates. 
Additionally, I managed response data by parsing JSON outputs to extract and process inference results effectively.
This experience has honed my skills in AWS integration, Python programming, JSON data handling, logging, and NLP techniques for model inference.
